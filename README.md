# Python Copy Paster
### Copies text to clipboard from a ".txt" file. 

> This python script gets random or ordered pieces of text from a text file and copies them to the clipboard. The user can choose what their text file is, if they want the ordered or random mode, how long it's gonna take to copy and how long it's gonna take the script to start. This can be used for annoying friends, memeing or trolling with things like the Bee Movie script.
